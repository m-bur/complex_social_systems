## readme:

The docs are automatically generated by sphinx, the code for this can be found in [source](source) and the result can be found in [build](build).

You can refresh the files in build, by just running `./make html` and `./make clean` is necessary (but usually `./make html`) should be fine. 

You can access the documentation in human readable format by opening [build/html/index.html](build/html/index.html) with your favorite browser.

If you want to open it from the command line, in Windows you can type for example:
`> & "C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" "C:\path\to\my_repo\docs\build\html\index.html"`  where you need to replace "C:\path\to\my_repo" with the actual path to your repo and ">" in the beginning is not part of the command.

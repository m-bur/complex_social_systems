# complex_social_systems

As our code will be judged by its quality and readability and of course also because it will be relevant for a good collaboration, we should all adherre to the same standard for comments.
I suggest we use [numpy doc style](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) for our code. This will also allow for automatic documentation using sphinx.

The documentation of our project can be found in the [docs](docs) folder. More instructions can be found there.
It can be opened with your favorite browser and looks something like this:
